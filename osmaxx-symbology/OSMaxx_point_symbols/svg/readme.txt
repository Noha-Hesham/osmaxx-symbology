svg to ttf automated conversion process

•	Clone pysvg2font module from https://github.com/carrasti/pysvg2font.git
•	Generate the ttf file as instructed on the documentation of the repository
•	Optionally, rearrange the order of the fonts using fontforge. https://fontforge.github.io/en-US/


Throughout the process, error "Failed to parse colour" will be generated. However, this error can be safely neglected.
